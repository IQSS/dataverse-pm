## About
This is the main repository for Dataverse-related project management tracking issues. By design, some of the documents, or other resources linked from tracking issues _may not be publicly accessible_.

## About Tracking Issues
Tracking issues are GitHub issues in the [dataverse-pm repo](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-pm) connecting connect development issues (e.g., in [dataverse](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse) 
or [dataverse-frontend](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-frontend) with deliverables, strategic objectives, and resource monitoring and reporting requirements.

Tracking issues:
- Provide predictable, accessible locations to record and retrieve status on any activity requiring tracking.
- Contain links to documentation, communications channels (e.g., Slack, Zulip), and other related resources.
- Occasionally appear on the Sprint Board when needed to account for on-going work not related to development (e.g., DevOps work). 

Dataverse Project team members should create a tracking issue in this repository whenever they need tasks tracked, managed, and reported on across multiple sprints.

## Tracking Issue Types
### Initiative
Broad strategic activity, usually without defined start/end dates. Includes projects and epics. 
### Project
Related tasks with defined start/end dates, deliverables, and stakeholders. May require multiple epics to complete.
### Epic
Related tasks without defined start/end dates; possibly of lengthy duration. May involve multiple subtasks. 
### Task
Smaller units of work (e.g., set of well-defined, related issues) that have specific deliverables. Usually part of epics.
### Proposal
Development of a proposal for investigating or addressing a problem. When approved, proposals may become projects or go into production. 
### Report
Development and delivery of a specific report (e.g., project status)
### Monitor
Issue for regular monitoring of a system, a resource, or other repeating task
